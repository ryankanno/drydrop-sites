       <h1>ANNOUNCEMENT:</h1>
       <h2>Arduino Night on Tuesday, March 29th at Oceanit!</h2>
       <p style="width:50%; margin:0 auto; text-align:left;">
            Get ready for our first ever HI Capacity Honolulu Hackerspace
            meeting.<br/><br/>
            We only have room for 20 so sign up fast! :)<br/><br/> 
            Please RSVP on Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=205143832832092"
            style="white-space:nowrap;" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=205143832832092</a>

       <p style="width:50%; margin:0 auto; text-align:left;">
           We'll be running through a basic demo of the Arduino for the first 
           hour - both programming and configuring the hardware. This will also 
           be the first Honolulu meet and greet to meet like-minded makers and 
           creatives. 
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p style="width:50%; margin:0 auto; text-align:left;">
           All attendees who want to participate in the demonstration will need 
           to buy an Arduino kit from Adafruit Industries: <a
           href="http://bit.ly/i9RlbZ" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/i9RlbZ</a>
           The price of the kit will run around $50 (with an additional $10 for 
           shipping). Please order this ASAP if you want to attend as it should 
           take about 3-5 business days to get to Hawaii. 
       </p>
       <br/>
       <p style="width:50%; margin:0 auto; text-align:left;">
           <b>Note: We'll be building on this kit in future - so think of it 
    as an investment!</b>
       </p>

            Oceanit (<a href="http://www.oceanit.com">http://www.oceanit.com/</a>) has graciously provided their 
            conference rooms for us to use for our very first meetup. They are 
            located at 828 Fort Street in Downtown Honolulu. (<a
            href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=oceanit+labs&aq=&sll=21.299428,-157.855834&sspn=0.010696,0.01929&gl=us&g=828+Queen+St,+Honolulu,+HI+96813&ie=UTF8&ll=21.310166,-157.859588&spn=0.02039,0.038581&z=15">
            Google Maps link</a>) Parking to Oceanit is on Queen St. If you're coming down Bishop, take a right on Queen, 
            and the entrance will be on your right after a wide crosswalk. (If you 
            hit Harbor Court, you've gone too far). It's $2 dollars for parking 
            through Park & Pay on each floor. 
       </p>

       <b>Hope to see you there!</b>
